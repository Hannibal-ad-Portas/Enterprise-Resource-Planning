# Enterprise-Resource-Planning

This is being developed for a school project. The purpose of the project is to provide a simpler, cheaper, and better enterprise solution for managing resources.

## Getting Started and Installation

After cloning the repository you will need to have NodeJS and Angular4 installed on your machine. Download the node install file from here:
- [NodeJS Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Make sure that you have npm installed as well and that all commands from npm and node are added to your path.

Once you have Node installed then you will want to grab the Angular4 cli. To do that, simply run the following command in the terminal:
- `npm install -g @angular/cli`

You can find all of the Angular documentation from here:
- [Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs)

Once you have finished getting everything set up then you are ready to run the server!

## Running the server

Running the server is quite simple. Type the following command into the terminal:
- `node run dev:server`

If this doesn't work then most likely the packages didn't transfer to the project when it was cloned. To re-download the packages run the following command:

- `npm install`

## API Routes

These are the routes that the api uses to push to and query the database
